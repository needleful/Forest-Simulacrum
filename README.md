# Forest Simulacrum: A(n incomplete) game made in the Godot Engine

## NOTICE
This game is CANCELLED!! 

Actually it's just undergoing a hard pivot and will not be completed in its current state.  I think it's a cute little walking sim, but it screams "Babby's first game", with the lack of mechanical depth, the eclectic assets, the ad-hoc (and incomplete) story, among other things.  But this was a valuable stepping-stone for the new design of the game, which sounds like something I'd actually want to play!

## THE ORIGINAL FUNNY TEXT

funy game but spooky!!!

do you like interactive pictures? do you want to make them and want to learn by example?  then i have the source code for my almost complete game in Godot Engine™ that you can read and attempt to understand

## Requirements

you will have to use the Godot 3.1 Alpha because I am using features not in Godot 3.0!

## Epic-with-the-B-emoji game features

- OST with Four original songs!

- Controller support: this was harder than it sounds because godot™ does not out-of-the-box support navigating UIs with the analog sticks (read `scripts/input.gd` if you want to see my implementation of this!!! you will probably want to modify it to disable when not in a UI because currently it spams input events when walking around!)

- Options Menu: You can bind the up button to X and it will work!!!  No volume controls and I will not add them!

## Addons

all addons are made by me but i made them addons so i could use them in other games in the future!! 

- Gradient Shader: a shader for making gradients!! i do not think it will be very useful for most games because it is two shaders and accompanying tools that are very specific to the look and feel of this game!!

- Peroxinator: a dialog system that i made for an unreleased game called _Peroxia_ and that is why it is called peroxinator. but the editor was originally in java and i lost the source code and it was bad so i made a new editor in godot! So it has literally nothing to do with Peroxia other than a common format!  Also I could not figure out custom resources so I hope that doesn't break the game!
