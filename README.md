# Forest Simulacrum: A game made in the Godot Engine
funy game but spooky!!!

do you like interactive pictures? do you want to make them and want to learn by example?  then i have the source code for my almost complete game in Godot Engine™ that you can read and attempt to understand


## Requirements

you will have to build Godot from source to run the project, because i am using some features that are not available in Godot 3.0!  when godot 3.1 is out i will stick to that so others can open it easier!  until that their [github is here](https://github.com/godotengine/godot) and the [tutorials for compiling are here](https://godot.readthedocs.io/en/3.0/development/compiling/index.html).  it is easy to build godot engine™ relative to other C++ projects, but I am a professional computer man so you may find it not very easy at all!!

## Addons

all addons are made by me but i made them addons so i could use them in other games in the future!! 

- Gradient Shader: a shader for making gradients!! i do not think it will be very useful for most games because it is two shaders and accompanying tools that are very specific to the look and feel of this game!!

- Peroxinator: a dialog system that i made for an unreleased game called _Peroxia_ and that is why it is called peroxinator. but the editor was originally in java and i lost the source code and it was bad so i made a new editor in godot!


### Other Considerations

do not read the dialog files with the .JSON and .DLG extensions or you will see spoilers!!!
